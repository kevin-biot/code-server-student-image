# Critical Path Plan: July 5-15
# ===============================

## Phase 1: Foundation Lockdown (July 5-7) - 72 Hours
### Day 1 (July 5) - Infrastructure Validation
- [x] Core infrastructure working (DONE)
- [ ] Deploy and test 25 student capacity 
- [ ] ArgoCD pipeline fix implementation
- [ ] Performance baseline establishment

### Day 2 (July 6) - Exercise Validation  
- [ ] Day 1 Pulumi exercise end-to-end test
- [ ] Day 2 Tekton exercise end-to-end test  
- [ ] Day 3 ArgoCD exercise validation
- [ ] Documentation review and gaps closure

### Day 3 (July 7) - Production Readiness
- [ ] Hardcoded values audit and fixes
- [ ] Bulk deployment scripts finalization
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Staff testing environment preparation

## Phase 2: Internal Testing (July 8-15) - 18 Hours
### Session Structure (4:00-7:00 PM KSA daily)
- **Days 1-2**: Exercise-specific testing (Groups A, B, C)
- **Days 3-4**: End-to-end integration testing (Group D)  
- **Days 5-6**: Issue resolution and re-testing

### Critical Success Factors
- [ ] >95% exercise completion rate
- [ ] No critical blocking issues
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load
- [ ] Clear issue resolution path

## Phase 3: Production Deployment (Post July 15)
### Pre-Client Checklist
- [ ] All critical issues resolved
- [ ] Repository migration completed
- [ ] Client-specific configurations applied
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Parallel workstreams**: Infrastructure + exercise validation
2. **Issue categorization**: Critical vs. nice-to-have fixes
3. **Fallback plans**: Manual workarounds for non-critical issues
4. **Stakeholder communication**: Daily progress updates
